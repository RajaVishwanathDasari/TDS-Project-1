# 1.  Data Scraping 
 I started by generating a GitHub REST API personal access token. Using this access token ,'requests' and 'csv' libraries of python, data scraping was done and the files 'users.csv' and 'repositories.csv' were created.
   
# 2. Interesting Fact
 The interesting fact I observed in the dataset was even with rise of Machine Learning and Data Science (after 2015) there is a downfall in use of Python in repositories but TypeScript's rise suggests that web development remains a crucial area for jobs in Stockholm, even as other fields like Machine Learning gain traction.

# 3. Actionable Recommendation to developers
 Based on trend, learning TypeScript, an extension of JavaScript, can significantly boost your employability in Stockholm. As TypeScript rises in popularity, mastering it enhances your value to employers seeking modern web development skills.
